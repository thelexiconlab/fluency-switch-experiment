# Idiosyncratic clusters

This repository hosts the code for a behavioral experiment where we explore how people navigate different items in semantic spaces and whether current automated methods of clustering and switching in these spaces align with human judgments.

- `experiment`: contains the code for the pre-registered rater experiment
- `data`: contains the data from the pre-registered experiment
- `analysis`: contains the code for the analysis of participant and rater data
- `forager_test`: contains code for using the python package *forager* to obtain predicted clusters and model estimates
